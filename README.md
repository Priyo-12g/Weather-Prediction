# Weather-Prediction
This projects first reads the data from the csv file. Then checks for null pointer. After that it takes a target key like the max temp for prediction of tommorow's temp. Then the alpha parameter controls how much the coefficients are shrunk to account for collinearity. At last it shows the graph of actual and predicted weather.
